```

```bash
python linked_to_epstein.py --contacts ~/Downloads/Connections.csv --min-mentions 5
```

## Reading the Output

The script generates an HTML report (`epstein_mentions_report.html` by default) that you can open in any web browser.

![A screenshot of the HTML report.](assets/screenshot.png)

The report contains:

- **Summary**: Total contacts searched and how many had mentions
- **Contact cards**: Each contact with mentions is displayed as a card showing:
  - Name, position, and company
  - Total number of mentions across all documents
  - Excerpts from each matching document
  - Links to the source PDFs on justice.gov

Contacts are sorted by number of mentions (highest first).

## Notes

- The search uses exact phrase matching on full names, so "John Smith" won't match documents that only contain "John" or "Smith" separately
- Common names may produce false positives—review the context excerpts to verify relevance
